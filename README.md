# Price-prediction-of-Used-Cars-Using-Machine-Learning-Algo-s-XGBoost-
This projects will help people to predict or know the prices of used cars and helps them to understand the key factors that contribute to used car prices

In This project we will train 3 ML Algo's:
1:Mulitiple linear regression 
2:Random Forest Regression 
3:XGBoost 
we will train these three Algo's to predict used car prices

We are going to focus on following objectives:

1.       Understand the business case study

2.       Import key Python libraries, dataset, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis like removing missing values, replacing characters, etc.

3.       Perform interactive data visualization using Seaborn and Plotly and WordCloud

4.       Prepare the data to increase the predictive power of Machine Learning models by One-Hot Encoding, Feature dropping, and Train/Test Split

5.       Build and train Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost models to predict the price of the used cars

6.       Calculate Regression Metrics from the trained models and compare the accuracy score
